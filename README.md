#Animate CSS sans vendor prefixes

Why? Because I wanted to do it. And animate.css as it is is huge. I use Gulp stuff to add necessary vendor prefixes when needed. And, heck, some of those will go the way of the dodo bird anyways.

##TODO:
break out all animations into animation groups, then individual animations.
Why? WTFK!!!!
